## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Download the Extension**:
   - Click on [Releases](https://github.com/musairul/SparxSolver/releases) and download the Source code zip

   <details>
   <summary>🟣 Mistral</summary>

   - Visit [Mistral Console](https://console.mistral.ai/)
   - Click "Sign Up" and create a free account
   - Once logged in, go to "API Keys" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Create new key"
   - Copy the generated API key
   - Uses mistral-medium-latest model which is a SOTA model

   </details>

   The free tier of these LLMs typically have a limit on number of requests per day, so I would recommend using all 3 and whenever one runs out just switch to another.

   Ive also noticed the LLMs work best on questions that dont have diagrams

   If there are any other LLMs with free tiers for their API that support image input, let me know and I will try to add it to the extension. 

6. **Paste API key into the extension**:
   - Go to maths.sparx-learning.com (the extension only opens on this link!)
   - Click on the extension
   - Select your provider from the dropdown and enter your API key

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **Extension not appearing after "Load unpacked"**:
    - Ensure you have selected the correct `SparxSolver` folder. If you see a `manifest.json` file directly inside the folder you selected, that's the correct one.
    - Double-check that "Developer mode" is enabled on the `chrome://extensions/` page.
    - Try restarting Chrome.
- **"Manifest not found" error**:
    - You have likely selected the wrong folder. When you unzip the downloaded file, it might create a folder like `SparxSolver-main` and inside that, another `SparxSolver` folder. Make sure you select the inner `SparxSolver` folder that directly contains the `manifest.json` file.
- **API Key not working**:
    - Ensure you have copied the API key correctly.
    - Verify that the API key is enabled and has the necessary permissions
    - Check if there are any restrictions on the API key (e.g., website restrictions) that might prevent it from working on `maths.sparx-learning.com`.
- **Extension popup doesn't open**:
    - Make sure you are on the `maths.sparx-learning.com` website, as the extension is designed to activate only on this domain.
    - Refresh the page and click on the extension again
